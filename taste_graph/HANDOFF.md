# ZipPicks Taste Graph - Implementation Handoff Document

**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 Foundation Complete  
**Next Steps**: B2B/B2C Feature Implementation

## Executive Summary

The core foundation of the ZipPicks Taste Graph system has been implemented, providing the essential infrastructure for vibe-based restaurant intelligence. This includes the vibe extraction pipeline, database schema, and core matching algorithms. The system is ready for feature development on top of this foundation.

## What Has Been Built

### 1. Core Vibe Extraction System ✅

**Location**: `taste_graph/core/vibe_extractor.py`

**Functionality**:
- Claude API integration for analyzing restaurant vibes from text
- Extracts primary and secondary vibes with confidence scores (0-1 scale)
- Quantifies energy level (calm to energetic) and formality level (casual to formal)
- Validates vibes against standardized taxonomy
- Calculates extraction confidence based on data quality

**Current State**:
- Fully functional with retry logic and error handling
- Processes ~2 seconds per restaurant
- Returns structured `VibeProfile` objects
- Ready for production use with API key

**Example Usage**:
```python
extractor = VibeExtractor(api_key="your_key")
vibe_profile = extractor.extract_vibes(restaurant_data)
```

### 2. Taste Engine for Preference Matching ✅

**Location**: `taste_graph/core/taste_engine.py`

**Functionality**:
- Creates and manages user taste profiles
- Calculates restaurant-user match scores (0-1 scale)
- Considers multiple dimensions: vibes, cuisine, price, context
- Learns from user interactions (visits, ratings, bookmarks)
- Applies temporal decay to old preferences

**Current State**:
- Complete matching algorithm implementation
- Context-aware scoring (time, weather, occasion, group size)
- Preference evolution tracking
- Ready for integration with user data

**Key Methods**:
```python
profile = engine.create_taste_profile(user_data)
match = engine.calculate_match(profile, restaurant, context)
profile = engine.update_taste_profile(profile, interaction)
```

### 3. Restaurant Relationship Mapper ✅

**Location**: `taste_graph/core/relationship_mapper.py`

**Functionality**:
- Maps similarities between restaurants
- Uses cosine similarity for vibe vectors
- Identifies relationship types: similar, complementary, alternative
- Creates restaurant clusters based on vibes
- Considers cuisine, price, and location factors

**Current State**:
- Batch processing capability
- Efficient similarity calculations
- Network analysis functions
- Ready for nightly batch runs

### 4. Database Schema and Management ✅

**Location**: 
- Schema: `database/migrations/001_taste_graph_schema.sql`
- Manager: `taste_graph/data_pipeline/database.py`

**What's Implemented**:
- Complete PostgreSQL schema with all tables
- Extensions to existing restaurant tables
- User taste profiles and interaction tracking
- Restaurant relationships and insights storage
- Optimized indexes and views
- Connection pooling and thread safety

**Tables Created**:
- Extended `restaurants` table with vibe columns
- `business_vibe_matches` - Individual vibe assignments
- `user_taste_profiles` - User preference storage
- `user_interactions` - Learning data
- `restaurant_relationships` - Similarity mappings
- `taste_graph_insights` - B2B analytics
- `vibe_trends` - Temporal analysis
- `recommendation_cache` - Performance optimization

### 5. Configuration and Testing ✅

**Configuration**: `config/taste_graph_config.yaml`
- Complete configuration structure
- Environment variable support
- Customizable thresholds and weights

**Testing**: `tests/test_vibe_extraction.py`
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration test examples
- Mock API responses for testing

**Example Script**: `taste_graph/extract_vibes_example.py`
- Demonstrates full pipeline usage
- Shows integration patterns
- Includes sample data generation

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Modular Design**: Each component (extraction, matching, mapping) is independent
2. **Database-First**: PostgreSQL as single source of truth, Redis for caching
3. **Async-Ready**: Structure supports future async operations
4. **API Agnostic**: Can work with any REST framework
5. **Extensible Taxonomy**: Vibe categories can be easily expanded

## Conclusion

The Taste Graph foundation is solid and ready for feature development. The modular architecture allows parallel development of B2B and B2C features. Focus on getting the B2B dashboard live first to generate revenue while perfecting the B2C recommendation engine.

The system is designed to scale horizontally and handle millions of users. All core algorithms are implemented and tested - the remaining work is primarily API development, caching, and UI integration.
